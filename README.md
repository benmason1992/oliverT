## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and NPM installed in your environment.

### Node
- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/benmason1992/oliverT
    $ cd oliverT
    $ npm install

## Running the project

    $ npm run dev
    
    Go to http://localhost:5000/name-count - to see a full list of names. You may need to change the :5000 to whatever port is stated in the console following $npm run dev.
    Go to http://localhost:5000/name-count/oliver to see a specific names count. I've used oliver as an example.
